As of June 7th 2014, this was on a "patch-1" branch and hadn't been merged into nickelpro's master.
The following change has been made:
mcp/mcdata.py lines 796-773, there seems to be a protocol glitch. Keep in mind when updating.
Check whether nickelpro has merged patch-1

A second hack, not pushed, has been made:
mcmap/smpmap2.py lines 111-113, preventing massive memory usage. We'd probably get into trouble flying now...
and of course, we will need a permanent solution.
